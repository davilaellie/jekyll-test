# User Documentation for Employee Injury Report Rewrite (EIR)

## Application Functions

The Employee Injury Report has two different steps to record an Orlando Health employee injury: new report creation and supervisor reporting review.

### Creating A New Injury Report

*** It is important to note that if a team member is hospitalized due to their injury, Corporate Safety should be paged ASAP at (407)-983-7416. Corporate Safety needs to be notified before completing a new Injury Report.
Additionally, if you required medical attention please follow up at Occupational Health within 48 hours. Please call Occupational Health Downtown at 321-841-5212 or Occupational Health West at 321-842-0505, Monday-Friday from 7:30am-4pm to schedule an appointment. Walk-ins are welcome. ***

Employees can create a new Employee Injury request by:

\1.   Navigating to https://custom.capps.orhs.org/EmployeeInjury/.

\2.   Typing in Team Member ID and credentials and Selecting “Enter a New Employee Injury Report.”
