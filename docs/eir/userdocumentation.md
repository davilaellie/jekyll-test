# User Documentation for Employee Injury Report Rewrite (EIR)

## Application Functions
***

The Employee Injury Report has two different steps to record an Orlando Health employee injury: new report creation and supervisor reporting review.

### Creating A New Injury Report
***

**It is important to note that if a team member is hospitalized due to their injury, Corporate Safety should be paged ASAP at (407)-983-7416. Corporate Safety needs to be notified before completing a new Injury Report.
Additionally, if you required medical attention please follow up at Occupational Health within 48 hours. Please call Occupational Health Downtown at 321-841-5212 or Occupational Health West at 321-842-0505, Monday-Friday from 7:30am-4pm to schedule an appointment. Walk-ins are welcome.**

Employees can create a new Employee Injury Report by:

1.   Navigating to https://custom.capps.orhs.org/EmployeeInjury/.

2.   Typing in Team Member ID credentials and Selecting “Enter a New Employee Injury Report.”

### Supervisor Work Injury Observation
***

Supervisors need to sign off on details regarding their employee’s work injury events. Supervisors will receive an incident number when an Employee Injury Report is submitted. 

Supervisors can submit an Incident Report form by:
1.    Navigating to https://custom.capps.orhs.org/EmployeeInjury/

2.    Navigating to the second box that says, “Supervisor Work Injury Observations,” typing in the unique Incident Number, and pressing “Search.”

3.    The Incident details will be displayed at the top of the page.

4.    Scroll down to find the Supervisor Management form. Completely fill out the form, leaving no blank fields.

5.    Once each field has been answered, press “Save” at the bottom right hand corner to submit the Supervisor Management form.

6.    If the form is completely submitted properly, a “success” notification will occur on the upper right corner of the page, which indicates the information is now being processed.
