# Employee Injury Report Rewrite (EIR)

## Introduction

The Employee Injury Report is a web application built in .NET for Orlando Health and its systems. The original Employee Injury Report was originally written in ColdFusion but has been updated and re-written to fit the more modern C# language in the .NET Framework. 

The Employee Injury Report is used to report Orlando Health employee injuries that occur on Orlando Health property. The Employee Injury Report allows employees and their supervisors to easily and quickly log any onsite injuries that happen at Orlando Health. In order to move forward with a Worker’s Compensation claim, an Employee Injury Report must be submitted to document an injury to an Orlando Health employee. Once an Employee Injury Report form is submitted, the report information is logged into the Oracle database, which is managed by PeopleSoft. The Health Safety team moves forward with injury reporting and policy once the Employee Injury Report is submitted.
